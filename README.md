To run the app, navigate to your terminal and type: 
```
$ cd purple-project2/
$ yarn
$ cd backend
$ yarn
$ cd..
$ cd client
$ yarn
$ cd ..

$ yarn start:dev
```
This will start both the React web app and backend server simultaneously and will automatically open the webapp on your browser.

If you want to only start the backend server: `$ yarn start:server`, and if you only want to start the React app: `$ yarn start:client`.
